# SpectrometerStuff

So there is a file called ```plotter_no_led.ino``` in the ArduinoCode folder. This has the main code for the spectrometer. 

And there is a ```plotter_no_led.py``` file in the PythonHelpers folder. This will plot the data when you have the Arduino connected running the code. Might need to change the name of the port and some of other little stuff but you got it.

I'll also add the other arduino and python scripts but those are the main ones.
