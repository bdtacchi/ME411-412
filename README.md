# ME411-412 Arduino and Python programs

This repo contains all the code used during the ME411 and ME412 semesters. The programs were used to read the data collected by a C12880ma spectrometer connected to an Arduino, along with other functionalities added in different versions of the main program. The python files were used to plot the data and save it to a .csv file.
